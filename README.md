# Basic Setup on Mac

* Install brew
* brew install pyenv, then setup pyenv shims
* brew install portaudio
* Install python 3.9.9 + (mac mini running 3.13.3)
* Create a pyenv or set global
* Pip install poetry in pyenv
* in python/parquette-lights/
	* Set to use pyenv with poetry
	* poetry sync
	* poetry run server

# Running the system

* Wiring
	* Connect DMX Entec Pro to mac mini via USB
	* Connect USB audio interface (or any audio input your computer detects), connect to line out from the DJ booth. There is currently a small amazon USB audio dongle that takes headphone jack input and an XLR to headphone adapter attached
	* Connect DMX Entec Pro via DMX cable (need a 5 to 3 pin adapter) to the dimmer pack above the washroom
* Software
	* Boot computer
	* Connect via screen share
		* Go to Finder on a mac
		* Press Cmd+K
		* enter vnc://pq@parquette-house-mm.local (note only accessible on the internal WiFi?)
		* Use password for wifi
		* Login with same password
	* Open "Open Stage Control" and hit the play button
	* Open terminal
		* cd ~/parquette/parquette-lighting/python/parquette-lights
		* poetry run server
* Config
	* Go to 192.168.1.245:8080 in your browser (note only accessible on the internal WiFi)
	* Go into "FFT and DMX Setup"
	* DMX
		* Press "Refresh DMX ports"
		* Select DMX port from drop down (if none you have a wiring problem with your Entec probably?)
		* You should be able to control lights, they will snap to the current settings
	* Audio
		* Press "Refresh Audio ports"
		* Select audio port from drop down
		* Wait 4-5s for backend to catchup configuring audio port
		* Press "Start Audio"
		* Wait 1-2s
		* Press "Start FFT"
		* You should see audio signal coming in to the FFT visualizer

## Notes/Ideas/TODOs
* Redundancy, RTFM and manual
* UX
	* Special UI (or object) for punch and other common actions
	* Sync values on load
* Presets and automations
	* Presets mechanism
	* Add all black button
	* House lights button
	* Parameter LFO / preset or mode LFO
	* Auto detection for low/high intensity of music that can trigger mode changes or similar
* Math problems
	* Add floor / ceil / scaling instead of just offest and mult for chans
	* No negative values?
	* Adjust how master level works
	* Per chanel multiplier levels
	* FWD/BACK memory slice needs the memory slices to be log spaced or similar, e.g. more slices at the short time scale and fewer slices at the long timescale
	* Bug with adjusting the period of osciallators causing jump
* Bugs
	* Improve threading issues, can we run faster
	* Timing / race condition with the threading causing punch issues and latency issues
	* Validate if we can reconfigure audio and dmx on the fly
	* Preset synth patch load is broken
* Light perception
	* Overall and per light brightness perception map
* BPM detection
	* BPM confidence, auto disables BPM driven effects
	* Show BPM and BPM confidence
	* Improve BPM smoother
	* Way to connect BPM to the other effects
* FFT 
	* Time averaging of FFT to substract and do bg removal on the FFT
	* FFTs should also be able to swap slicing without rewiring? Or some better mechanism for swapping behavior, similar to idea with waves
	* Annotate FFT with key freqs
* New ideas
	* Separate Punch for blinders - perma linked
	* Spinning mode
	* Switch to dual spectrograms for harmonic and percussive
	* Wave generators should be able to switch shapes without rewiring in the patchbay?
	* Can I move the mapping definitions for output mix into the front end fully?
	* Auto load channel and generator names from the front end or scrupting to sync between front and backend
	* Align stutter automatically to beat quantization
