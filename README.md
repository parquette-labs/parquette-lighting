# Parquette Lighting ðŸª©ðŸª´ðŸ•ºðŸª©ðŸ•ºðŸª´ðŸª©

# Basic Setup on Mac

* Install [brew](https://brew.sh/)
* `brew install pyenv` then [setup pyenv shims](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#macos)
* `brew install portaudio`
* Install python 3.9.9 + (mac mini running 3.13.3), e.g. `pyenv install 3.13.3`
* Create a pyenv or set global, e.g. `pyenv virtualenv parquette 3.13.3` and `pyenv local parquette` in the repo
* `pip install poetry` in the pyenv
* in python/parquette-lights/
	* `poetry sync`
	* `poetry run server`

# Running the system

* Wiring
	* Connect DMX Entec Pro to mac mini via USB
	* Connect USB audio interface (or any audio input your computer detects), connect to line out from the DJ booth. There is currently a small amazon USB audio dongle that takes headphone jack input and an XLR to headphone adapter attached
	* Connect DMX Entec Pro via DMX cable (need a 5 to 3 pin adapter) to the dimmer pack above the washroom
* Software
	* Boot computer, current mac mini is set to auto boot when it has power
	* Connect via screen share
		* Go to Finder on a mac
		* Press Cmd+K
		* enter `vnc://pq@parquette-house-mm.local` (note only accessible on the internal WiFi?)
		* Use password for wifi for the screen share
		* Login to the machine with same password
	* Open "Open Stage Control" from Applications and hit the play button
	* Open terminal
		* `cd ~/parquette/parquette-lighting/python/parquette-lights`
		* `poetry run server`
* Config
	* Go to [http://192.168.1.245:8080](http://192.168.1.245:8080) in your browser (note only accessible on the internal WiFi)
	* Go into "FFT and DMX Setup"
	* DMX
		* Press "Refresh DMX ports"
		* Select DMX port from drop down (if none you have a wiring problem with your Entec probably?)
		* Selecting an item from the menu connects to it
		* You should be able to control lights, they will snap to the current settings
	* Audio
		* Press "Refresh Audio ports"
		* Select audio port from drop down
		* Wait 4-5s for backend to catchup configuring audio port
		* Press "Start Audio"
		* Wait 1-2s
		* Press "Start FFT"
		* You should see audio signal coming in to the FFT visualizer

# Repo information

* `/open-stage-control` contains the configuration for the open stage control front end, the `layout-config.json` contains the front end design, the other files are the server and UI initial state
* `/python/parquette-lights` contains the python server
	* `/python/parquette-lights/params.pickle` contains the presets, it is auto updated when you adjust the presets in the front end (by clicking save or clear preset). You of course have to save and commit those changes for them to persist

## Notes/Ideas/TODOs
* Some kind of visualizer to test in realtime without lights
* Presets and automations
	* Split up presets between for washes (ambient) and reds (active) lighting
	* Interpolate between presets when you switch over
	* Split off the master levels from the presets
* Math problems
	* Adjust how master level works
	* Add floor / ceil / scaling instead of just offest and mult for chans
	* Prevent negative values
	* Per chanel master multipler sliders
	* FWD/BACK memory slice needs the memory slices to be log spaced or similar, e.g. more slices at the short time scale and fewer slices at the long timescale
	* Bug with adjusting the period of osciallators causing jump
* Bugs
	* Preset synth patch load is broken
	* Improve threading issues, can we run faster
	* Timing / race condition with the threading causing punch issues and latency issues
	* Validate if we can reconfigure audio and dmx on the fly
* Light perception
	* Overall and per light brightness perception map
* BPM detection
	* BPM confidence, auto disables BPM driven effects
	* Show BPM and BPM confidence
	* Improve BPM smoother
	* Way to connect BPM to the other effects
* FFT 
	* Time averaging of FFT to substract and do bg removal on the FFT
	* FFTs should also be able to swap slicing without rewiring? Or some better mechanism for swapping behavior, similar to idea with waves
	* Annotate FFT with key freqs
* New ideas
	* <s>Run open stage control on CLI</s>
	* <s>Auto start process</s>
	* Auto detection for low/high intensity of music that can trigger mode changes or similar
	* Blue/green deploy mechanism
	* Optimize compute by idyling FFT and BPM when there is no audio and/or no interaction for multiple days
	* Separate / perma linked punch for blinders
	* Spinning mode
	* Switch to dual spectrograms for harmonic and percussive
	* Wave generators should be able to switch shapes without rewiring in the patchbay? Or general rethink of the patchbay
	* Can I move the mapping definitions for output mix into the front end fully?
	* Auto load channel and generator names from the front end or scrupting to sync between front and backend
	* Align stutter automatically to beat quantization
