# Parquette Lighting 🏋️‍♀️🕺🪩🕺🏋️‍♀️

## Notes/Ideas
* Add floor / ceil / scaling instead of just offest for chans
* General presets with a way to cycle between them
* Mode LFO and/or intensity driven mode switcher
* Remote for impule and mode change
* Replace audio with librosa
* Use psychoacoustic scale for FFT, display with log binning
* Switch to dual spectrograms for harmonic and percussive, run beat detection, mel scale via librosa
* Annotate FFT with freqs
* Beat matching / calculation
* Accounting for incandescent delay
* Add modes for the 2 new lights
* Add controls for the tungsten spot
